  *   It has allowed the creation of cube textures.
  *   Textures transfer to RAM has been fixed.

  *   A new class, UniformBufferBinding has been created which depends on both UniformBuffer and ShaderProgram.
  *   Instances of this class are held by RenderPipeline.
  *   FrameVariable class has been split in two classes: Uniform (for uniform variables contained in a UniformBuffer) and PushUniform (for uniform variables out of a UniformBuffer).

  *   ResourceManager views.
  *   Now, the ShaderProgram retrieves the vertex inputs layout. This layout is
  *   used in Submesh, to create the appropriate GeometryBuffers.
  *   Castor3D now renders the scenes using HDR and tone mapping. The default
  *   tone mapping configuration will make the render look like there were no
  *   HDR enabled.
  *
  * GlRenderSystem
  *   Lights texture now uses Texture Buffer Objects.
  *   Removed every GlXxxRenderer class, except for GlOverlayRenderer.

  *         to the function to retrieve so no more casts when using
  *         DynamicLibrary::GetFunction.
  *     Added log level support for Logger.
  *     Implemented intersection function in Line3D.
  *     That class now has to named constructors : FromPointAndSlope and

  *     Created two classes Size and Position instead of just having a typedef
  *         for these.
  *     Improved FileParser, now functions have parameters and not only
  *         parameters types, and parameters parse themselves.
  *     Castor::Point now holds a static array as it's members instead of a
  *         dynamic one.
  *     Removed Unicode file encoding.
  *     Added stream indentation support.
  *

  *     Introducing SamplerState class to group calls to SetSamplerState and
  *         all relative stuff.
  *     Reviewed sizes a bit : Viewport holds the internal size, RenderTarget
  *         and RenderWindow hold external size. Modified  SceneFileParser,
  *         added <size> directive for viewport.
  *     Splitted eBUFFER_MODE in eBUFFER_ACCESS_TYPE and eBUFFER_ACCESS_NATURE.
  *     Modified a bit FrameVariable in order to take care of 
  *         eFRAME_VARIABLE_TYPE previously defined for SceneFileParser.

  *     Merged GpuBuffer::Initialise and GpuBuffer::SetShaderProgram functions
  *         to ease their use.
  *     Removed auto mipmap generation, now if user wants it, he does it with
  *         DynamicTexture::GenerateMipmaps function.
  *     Added DepthStencilState class to manage those buffers states like
  *         Direct3D 11 (who does it well).

  *     Put a BlendState instance in Pass and removed rgb/alpha blending from
  *         the pass.
  *     Removed Context::Enable and Context::Disable, removed RenderState
  *         class.
  *     Removed SetPolygonMode from Context.

  *     Implemented mesh instantiation on hardware.
  *     Modified Submesh normals generation.
  *     Moved materials from Submesh to Geometry.
  *     Modified submeshes instance count, to make it specific to
  *         the materials used by the submesh instances.

  *         -f/--file to load a scene on startup
  *         -h/--help to display help
  *         -l/--level to define log level : - 0 for debug to errors
  *                                          - 1 for release to errors
  *                                          - 2 for warnings to errors
  *                                          - 3 for errors only.

  *         compilers.
  *     Modified Point, moved functions that shouldn't be in that class in a
  *         small helper class : point. It holds normalise, get_normalised,
  *         dot, all distance functions, cos_theta, negate.
  *     Modified FileParser in order to be able to ignore complete sections
  *         without commenting it (such as HLSL shader blocks in
  *         GlRenderSystem...).
  *     Modified FileParser to take care of parsers parameters.
  *     Reduced images memory occupation.
  *     Removed Point::link, Point::copy/clopy/clone functions.
  *     Replaced macros for cstrnlen, cstrftime, cstrncpy, cfopen, cfopen64,
  *         cfseek and cftell by functions in namespace Castor.
  *     Modified Colour class, it doesn't extend Point4f anymore.
  *     Removed macro DECLARE_SHARED_PTR, now using  DECLARE_SMART_PTR, so I
  *         replaced each XXxPtr by it's equivalent XxxSPtr.
  *
  * Castor3D
  *     Merged Submesh and SmoothingGroup classes.
  *     Reduced memory size of vertex buffers.
  *     Modified Submesh::ComputeTangents to take care of each vertex normal.
  *     Modified BufferElementGroup so it can't hold anymore its buffer.
  *     When initialising Pass, the texture units are re-ordered so the ones 
  *         with a defined channel come first.
  *     Passes now initialise their shaders in Pass::Initialiser instead of
  *	        trying to do it at each frame.
  *     Changed RenderTarget : now it only holds frame buffer and all needed
  *         for that. It is now a Renderable so TargetRenderer has been
  *         created.
  *     RenderWindow no longer extends RenderTarget, but now it has a
  *	        RenderTarget as a private class member.
  *     Created TextureBase class, StaticTexture and DynamicTexture to help
  *	        implementing render targets.
  *     RenderTarget now uses RenderTechnique to make its rendering.
  *     Created GeometryBuffers class which holds a Vertex buffer and an Index
  *	        buffer, they are created by the RenderSystem.
  *     Moved RenderTechnique basic frame buffer, texture and depth buffer into
  *         RenderTarget.
  *     Moved TargetRenderer::PostRender code into RenderWindow.
  *     Created WindowRenderer::EndScene function to prepare the render of the
  *         RenderTarget's frame buffer into the window.
  *     Removed calls to ShaderObject in order to make it more internal to
  *         Castor3D.
  *     Overlays are no more Renderable, there is one instance of OverlayRenderer
  *         class in the OverlayManager. All overlays will be rendered through
  *         this instance by the OverlayManager.
  *     Modified Scene, added template functions to add, remove or get
  *         an object whatever it's type may be (Light, Geometry, Camera, 
  *         SceneNode).
  *
  * GlRenderSystem
  *     Reviewed Vertex Array Objects, they now hold their buffers so the
  *         choice of using it or not is wrapped into it.
  *     Geometry shader work in OpenGL, created a shader to show wireframe
  *         models with Normals, Tangents and Bitangents.
