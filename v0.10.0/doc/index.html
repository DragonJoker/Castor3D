<h2><a class="anchor" id="feat_0_9_0"></a>
Features</h2>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="feat_0_9_0_cu"></a>
CastorUtils</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Dropped libzip, and added minizip to the source tree. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="feat_0_9_0_c3d"></a>
Castor3D</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Entire review of the render loop: RenderPipeline is no more a unique instance, but it actually contains the states, the program, and uniform buffer bindings.<br />
 It has been done to prepare the arrival of Vulkan, in which the pipeline can't be modified once it has been created, and that is now the case in Castor3D too. </li>
<li>
The rendering has been splitted in RenderPasses, that each have one or more RenderQueues, that are updated asynchronously on CPU.<br />
 This allows the GPU loop to be cleaned of most CPU computations. </li>
<li>
Skybox have been added. </li>
<li>
Binary export has been completely reviewed, it now uses a chunk data format (like LWO or 3DS).<br />
 It is used for meshes, and skeletons. </li>
<li>
Plug-ins interface's consistency has been improved. </li>
<li>
Fog basic implementations (linear, exponential, and squared exponential) have been added. </li>
<li>
Morphing (per-vertex) animations are now supported by Castor3D. </li>
<li>
Frustum culling has been implemented. </li>
<li>
Colour picking has been implemented. </li>
<li>
Shadow mapping is implemented, lights can produce shadows, and objects can cast shadows. </li>
<li>
Particle system has been implemented, giving to the user the implementation choice (CPU through class override, GPU through Transform Feedback or Compute shaders). </li>
<li>
Fixed the lighting in GLSL, to make it behave properly without dirty hacks. </li>
<li>
Compute shaders have been integrated to Castor3D, along with Shader Storage Buffers and Atomic Counter Buffers. </li>
<li>
Textures implementation have been completely reviewed, we now have TextureLayout, which holds the TextureImage(s), and the TextureStorage per image.<br />
 It has allowed the creation of cube textures. </li>
<li>
Textures transfer to RAM has been fixed. </li>
<li>
Billboard rendering no more uses a geometry shader, it now relies on hardware instantiation of a quad, and the positions are given as side attributes. </li>
<li>
UniformBuffer (formerly FrameVariableBuffer) no longer depends on ShaderProgram. </li>
<li>
A new class, UniformBufferBinding has been created which depends on both UniformBuffer and ShaderProgram.<br />
 Instances of this class are held by RenderPipeline. </li>
<li>
FrameVariable class has been split in two classes: Uniform (for uniform variables contained in a UniformBuffer) and PushUniform (for uniform variables out of a UniformBuffer). </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="feat_0_9_0_gl"></a>

<ul>
<li>
Updated to support the features provided by Castor3D. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="feat_0_9_0_tec"></a>
Techniques</h3>

<li>
DeferredRenderTechnique is now the default render technique, when none is specified. </li>
</ul>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="feat_0_9_0_pos"></a>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="version_0_6_1_2"></a>
Version 0.6.1.2</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="adds_0_6_1_2"></a>
adds</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Created Dx9Renderer to render with Direct3D 9. Stills things to correct, in shaders and matrices, but it's almost done. </li>
<li>
Created different files for OpenGL contexts (X11, Gtk, Msw), X11 and Gtk still untested. </li>
<li>
Created a splash screen for CastorViewer and CastorShape, created a dialog box in order to choose the renderer at startup. </li>
<li>
Added a small app to converet from an image to a XPM. </li>
<li>
Added new features to scene files (alpha_rejection, rgb_blend, alpha_blend, hl_shader_program, ...) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mods_0_6_1_2"></a>
Modifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Optimised CMakeLists file and 'cmake_modules' files in order to take care of various configurations in a better way. </li>
<li>
Revised VertexBuffers and IndexBuffers, introducing VertexDeclaration and BufferElementGroup, so we can create VertexBuffersof customisable types. </li>
<li>
Vertex class now derives from BufferElementGroup. </li>
<li>
TextureEnvironment are going to disappear in the next version, now multitexturing management is done with passes and texture units. </li>
<li>
Suppressed GLU dependencies. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="bugs_0_6_1_2"></a>
Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Trouble with Direct3D matrices (maybe differences between right-handed / left-handed). </li>
<li>
Trouble with HLSL shaders, surely linked to previous trouble. </li>
<li>
Still troubles with Cg shaders (not worked on it). </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="version_0_6_1_1"></a>
Version 0.6.1.1</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="adds_0_6_1_1"></a>
adds</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Created a CMakeLists file to generate the solution from CMake. </li>
<li>
Reorganised folders to make them more compliant with CMake. </li>
<li>
Splitted Plugin class in 3 parts : Renderer, Divider et Importer. </li>
<li>
Created one project per importer (OBJ, PLY, MD2, MD3, 3DS, ...) </li>
<li>
PNTrianglesDivider is left in Castor3D because it is sstill used by Icosahedron, LoopDivider is exported in a plug-in. </li>
<li>
Began Cg shaders implementation. This implies a scene file modification because in Cg, uniform variables are are linked to a shader instead of being linked to the whole program. Still buggy. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mods_0_6_1_1"></a>
Modifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Suppressed FreeImagePlus dependencies. </li>
<li>
Vertex, Attribute and Index buffers are now created by RenderSystem so they can be created out of the renderers. </li>
<li>
Suppressed Singletons for the Managers (Image, Font, Scene, Material, Animation and Mesh). </li>
<li>
Remerged SceneNode classes. </li>
<li>
Created IdPoint class, it is a point with just an index. Submes::addPoint creates now IdPoints and Submesh::addFace uses them to create the vertex. </li>
<li>
Subdividers can subdivide in a thread in order not to freeze the main thread. It is possible to define a function to use at the end of the subdivision (cf. CastorShape). </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="bugs_0_6_1_1"></a>
Corrections</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Corrected LoopDivider which didn't reposition the Vertex </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="version_0_6_1_0"></a>
Version 0.6.1.0</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="adds_0_6_1_0"></a>
adds</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Using std or tr1 or boost smart pointers. </li>
<li>
Created OpenGlCommon for common treatments between GL2RenderSystem and GL3RenderSystem </li>
<li>
Created class RenderPipeline which performs the matrix computings and other functions (frustum, perspective, ortho, ...) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mods_0_6_1_0"></a>
Modifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Modified MemoryManager, added a template class MemoryTraced which overload new, delete new [] et delete [] operators in order to have better trace of allocations and deallocations. Each Castor class derive from this one and 3 files are created in root folder to log allocations, deallocations : memoryleaks.log, memoryalloc.log and memorydealloc.log </li>
<li>
TransformationUniform no longer exists, it is now a collection of functions which computes 4x4 matrix operations </li>
<li>
Modification SceneNode management : base class NodeBase holds the informations that were in SceneNode, 3 derived classes (GeometryMaterial, CameraMaterial et LightMaterial) take care of each category specificities. </li>
<li>
MovableObject class now has less features (name and NodeBase), Light and Camera now derive from it </li>
<li>
Renamed UniformVariable to . </li>
<li>
OpenGL 3.x/4.x now fully supported. </li>
<li>
Modified Vertex class in order to make them include texture coordinates and normals in order to have only 1 vertex buffer instead of 3 in a mesh. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="bugs_0_6_1_0"></a>
Corrections</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Corrected the shutdown crash. </li>
<li>
Corrected the black render with OpenGL 3.x </li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="version_0_6_0_0"></a>
Version 0.6.0.0</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="adds_0_6_0_0"></a>
adds</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Added a projection/normal and view matrices management class, in order to suppress the fixed pipeline support in OpenGl renderers. </li>
<li>
Added personnal smart pointers. </li>
<li>
Added an agle management class in order not to take care of degrees or radians. </li>
<li>
Added a path class, to manage slashes or backslashes according to OS. </li>
<li>
Created thread safe containers derived from STL ones (vector, list, map, multimap, set). </li>
<li>
Splitted GLRenderer in two parts : one compatible OpenGL 2.x and before (GL2RenderSystem), one compatible OpenGL3.x et after (GL3RenderSystem). </li>
<li>
GL2RenderSystem : according to client configuration, the fixed pipe is suppressed or keeped </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mods_0_6_0_0"></a>
Modifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Modified thread management, leaving the user choosing between Win32, MFC or boost. </li>
<li>
Modified point and matrices classes. </li>
<li>
Modified String class which now is independant from MBCS or Unicode. </li>
<li>
Modified File class which now only uses streams. </li>
<li>
Modified the render system, added a class Renderable used to create associated renderer in order to ease the creation of derived classes (submesh, scene node, light, camera...) </li>
<li>
Changed scenes/materials/meshes files name (respectively cscn/cmtl/cmsh) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="fix_0_6_0_0"></a>
Corrections</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Protected managers with recursive mutexes to avoid random crashes. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="bugs_0_6_0_0"></a>
Bugs</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Still a crash at shutdown, supposedly due to shaders. </li>
<li>
In GL3RenderSystem, I've got a black screen (?!?) but transformations seem to be correct. </li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="version_0_5_0_1"></a>
Version 0.5.0.1</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="adds_0_5_0_1"></a>
adds</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Tangent space is computed and available in GLSL shaders. </li>
<li>
Only tangent is computed, bitangent can be in the shader with a cross product. </li>
<li>
To access to the tangent you must declare the following attribute in the vertex shader : </li>
<li>
attribute vec3 tangent; </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="mods_0_5_0_1"></a>
Modifications</h2>
<ul>
<li>
The points classes have their members in a union so you can call it as you wish (xyz, rgb, left right top bottom) </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="bugs_0_5_0_1"></a>
Corrections</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Corrected the crash on shutdown. It was due to VBOs which are now destroyed in a final render loop. </li>
</ul>
