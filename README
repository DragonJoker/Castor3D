Castor3D is a 3D engine written in C++.
It works on Windows and also on GNU/Linux.
It uses OpenGL (with GLSL).

#   **                       II. Building Castor3D                           **
#   **-----------------------------------------------------------------------**

Castor3D uses CMake to build project files.
You just need to launch CMake to build your preferential project file.

Tested compilers are:
- Visual Studio 2013
- Visual Studio 2015
- gcc 4.7
- gcc 4.9
- gcc 5.3

CastorUtils depends on FreeImage and FreeType, Zlib and libzip.
Castor3D is based on CastorUtils.
GuiCommon depends on wxWidgets (from 2.9.5, currently 3.0).
Last (but not least) CastorViewer depends on GuiCommon, Castor3D and wxWidgets.

Some plug-ins are also built :
Renderers:
- GlRenderSystem depends on OpenGL (not GLU).

Importers:
- ASE, 3DS, LWO, OBJ, PLY, MD2, MD3.
- ASSIMP: Depends on Assimp, replaces the previous ones, except for PLY.

Dividers:
- Loop subdivision surfaces.
- Phong tessellation.
- PN-Triangles surfaces.

Techniques:
- Direct: Default one, nothing special about it.
- MSAA: Multi-sampling anti aliasing
- SSAA: Super-sampling anti aliasing

PostEffects:
- Bloom.

Generic:
- CastorGUI: to build GUIs inside Castor3D scenes.

Two additional projects are also generated:
- ImgConverter : Allows you to convert any image file type to XPM or ICO.
- CastorUtilsTest : Allows you to run unit and performance tests for CastorUtils.

Documentation for CastorUtils and Castor3D can be generated using Doxygen.

On GNU/Linux the default install directory is in /usr/local.
You can change this directory by changing the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX value.
The sample, tool and test applications are installed in <install_dir>/bin/
The main libraries (CastorUtils and Castor3D) are installed in
<install_dir>/lib/ on GNU/Linux, and in <install_dir>/bin/ on Windows.
The plug-ins are installed in <install_dir>/lib/Castor3D/

The build is configurable through CMake using the following options:
- PROJECTS_BINARIES_OUTPUT_DIR
    Used to specify the root directory for compiled binaries.
    inside this folder, the bin, lib, and share directories will be created,
    and binaries will be put in the right folders.
    Some files will also be copied in share directory, that are used by the
    projects.
    On Windows, the external DLLs will be copied here, if they are found.

- PROJECTS_USE_PRECOMPILED_HEADERS
    Used to enable/disable the use of Precompiled Headers for the compilation.

- PROJECTS_USE_PRETTY_PRINTING
    If it is enabled, and if A-Style is found, new test projects will be
    created, allowing the run of A-Style over each project's source file.

- CASTOR_BUILD_CASTOR3D:
    This special option allows you to disable build of Castor3D, and every
    other project depending on it, resulting in the build of CastorUtils and
    CastorUtilsTest only.

- CASTOR_BUILD_PLUGINS:
    Another special option allowing you to disable the build of plug-ins.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_DIVIDER:
    Enables the build of Divider plug-ins.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_GENERIC:
    Enables the build of Generic plug-ins.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_IMPORTER:
    Enables the build of Importer plug-ins.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_INTEROP:
    Enables the build of Bindings.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_POSTFX:
    Enables the build of PostEffect plug-ins.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_SAMPLE:
    Enables the build of sample applications.

- CASTOR_BUILDGRP_TOOL:
    Enables the build of tools ()applications and tests).

- CASTOR_BUILD_DIVIDER_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> divider plug-in.

- CASTOR_BUILD_GENERIC_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> generic plug-in.

- CASTOR_BUILD_IMPORTER_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> importer plug-in.

- CASTOR_BUILD_INTEROP_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> binding.

- CASTOR_BUILD_POSTFX_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> post-effect plug-in.

- CASTOR_BUILD_RENDERER_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> renderer plug-in.

- CASTOR_BUILD_SAMPLE_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> sample application.

- CASTOR_BUILD_TECHNIQUE_<NAME>:
    Enables the build of <Name> technique plug-in.

- CASTOR_BUILD_TEST:
    Allows you to build test applications.

- CASTOR_FORCE_ALL_IMPORTERS:
    Forces the build of every importer plug-in, even though AssimpImporter is
    built.

- CASTOR_USE_SSE2:
    Enables use of SSE2 instructions for Poit4f and Matrix4x4f operations.

To run Castor Viewer, just type 'CastorViewer' in your favourite command-line
tool.

1. I need a feature that Castor3D do not implement, what should I do ?

There are two ways.
First, Castor3D is a LGPL software and library, so you are welcome to improve
it yourself ;-) !
Second, just ask the author :-) ! 

2. I implemented a cool feature, can I commit it ?

Obviously you are welcome to send the author any improvement. But obviously
the author is quite careful with readability, correctness and stability, 
and will read and check any contribution before including it.
Thus, it can take time... There are few basic rules to write contributions:
- (1) Do never change the indentation of any part of the code that's not yours.
- (2) Do never send codes without a lot of comments in (bad or good) English.
- (3) Do never send codes with obscure and/or non-English variable names.

3. How can I ask the author ?

Just send a mail to dragonjoker59@hotmail.com !
