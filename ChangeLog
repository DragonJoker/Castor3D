	* OpenGL Vertex Array Objects.

2012-11-14  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

2012-10-31  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Correcting HLSL shaders, done diff, diff-bump, diff-bump-spec,
	* diff-bump-alph and diff-bump-alph-spec.
	* When initialising Pass, the texture units are re-ordered so the ones with
	* a defined channel come first.
	* Corrected a bug in SMaxImporter, replaced eTEXTURE_CHANNEL_COUNT by
	* eTEXTURE_CHANNEL_ALL which is more correct since the channels are flags
	* and not indices.

2012-10-28  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Implemented intersection function in Line3D. 
	* That class now has to named constructors : FromPointAndSlope and 
	* FromPoints, to avoid confusion between them.
	* Subdivider::DoComputeCenterFrom now uses Line3D::Intersects between the
	* lines formed by the 2 points and their normals.
	* SMaxImporter now also imports bump, opacity and specular maps.
	* Scene::Render now takes a Camera in parameter to be able to sort nodes
	* according to their distance to the camera (to have correct alpha
	* blending).
