2016-12-14  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Introduced UniformBufferBinding class, which is the link between a program and a UBO.
	* Now RenderPass holds its UBOs, as do other classes that create their pipelines (Context, ToneMappings, PostEffects, ...).
	* Now, I have to debug that.

2016-12-13  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Program has been removed from UniformBuffer.
	* Added a message in UniformBuffer when its initialisation fails.

2016-12-12  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

2016-12-7  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* All bind methods now have void return type instead of bool.
	* All dependant functions have been updated consequently, most of them now have a void return type too.
	* ShaderProgram initialisation and binding has been modified to behave like the other classes of the engine.
	* I has allowed me to highlight the declaration of frame variables that was not present in the shaders.
	* Hence, I have updated the program and texture flags modification from the render passes.

	* The changes are done, now I must test them.
	* Fixed pixel format test
	* Removed TPL_PIXEL_FORMAT macro
	* Removed extra qualifier in header.
	* DeferredRenderTechnique and DeferredMsaaRenderTechnique now support shadows, and also objects that don't receive shadows.
	* Added a way to check for the texture units completeness before a draw call, in GlDebug.
	* It helped me fix the sampler unbind bug.
	* But it didn't help fix the noisy message which is still there.
	* Looks like it is related to a shader using shadow samplers with no textures bound to it, which is not the case...
	* So I temporarily filtered the message out, but it needs investigation on its own.
	* CastorTD now uses shadows too.

2016-12-6  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Submesh's matrix buffers are now updated in a pre-render event, instead of queue-render
	* Added "Trace" log level (lower than debug, it displays notifications from OpenGL Debug Output).
	* Reworked GlDebug's debug callbacks, to make them more concise, and now each severity level matches a log level.
	* Created common functions in render pass, to copy instantiated nodes matrices.
	* DeferredMsaaRenderTechnique now uses shadows correctly too.
	* Fixed the memory issue when a log level was given as command line parameter.
	* Still the noisy message about shader/texture/sampler mismatch, since I don't know where it comes from, I'll probably need to store the state for currently bound OpenGL objects, in GlDebug...

2016-12-6  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Now objects have the "shadow receiver" property.
	* Now objects have the "shadow receiver" property.

	* I've also had to modify the mouse events to make them post post-render events.

2016-11-9  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Bloom is fixed.
	* The problem in the UBO was due to the stride of float arrays in it.
	* This stride is 16 bytes (size of a vec4), hence my values were packed instead of being dispatched with this stride.
	* I have added support for other UBO layouts (packed and shared).

2016-11-8  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Modified the behavior of GlFrameVariableBuffer, to upload it only when needed.

	* Generalising ParticleSystem.
	* It is nearly done, but still not functional, needs some more debugging.
	* ParticleSystem is now working (I forgot the billboards dimensions, so it probably worked before).
	* Now I need to generalise it.

2016-10-26  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>

	* Point light shadow maps are now a cube map array.
	* Fixed frame saving colours swap.
	* Fixed the lights problems I had when I applied a bias to the reference depth in shadow mapping.
	* It has allowed me to remove the fixed pipeline polygon offset that was applied instead of the bias in GLSL.
	* Modified GlslWriter::GetLocale to make it more type safe (removed the implementation with Expr, and the assignment parameter must now be of the template return type).
	* Removed LOCALE and LOCALE_ASSIGN macros, in GlslWriter.

2016-10-17  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Something really wrong I think...
	* Can't use samplerCubeArray for point lights (needs OpenGL 4.0, and layered rendering), so I'll keep the samplerCube for now.
	* I have a ShadowMapPassPoint that doesn't work, but that doesn't produce any OpenGL error anymore.
	* Spot light shadow mapping uses a sampler2DArrayShadow.

	* Updated translations.

2016-02-11  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Debug overlays are no longer shown in Scene Tree.

2012-07-24  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* SMaxImporter : Corrected, with materials and textures
	* Castor3D : Modified normals generation, now ComputeNormals take an
	*   additional parameter that is the normal's type (flat or smooth)
	* ObjImporter : Correcting materials and textures import.

2012-07-20  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* AseImporter : Corrected, it now uses FileParser as it is a brace text
	*   file format.

2012-07-19  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* CastorUtils : Modified FileParser in order to be able to ignore complete
	*   sections without commenting it (HLSL shader blocks in 
	*   GlRenderSystem...)
	* SMaxImporter : Correcting.

2012-07-18  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Castor3D : Modified shaders, they now take care of the shader model, they
	*   hold all defined files and sources for each model, the choice of the
	*   source is  made at compile time, taking the source of the highest
	*   supported model (from 1 to 5).
	* Castor3D : Modified SceneFileParser, "file" functions for shaders now
	*   take an additional parameter that is the shader model.
	* MD2Importer : Corrected.
	* MD3Importer : Corrected.
	* Castor3D : Corrected SceneNode transformation matrix.
	* CastorViewer : Rotating no longer rotates camera but RootObjectNode.

2012-07-17  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Castor3D : Corrected lights and pipeline.
	* Castor3D : Now the functions that need a shader take it in parameter.
	* Dx9RenderSystem : Corrected.

2012-07-16  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* GlRenderSystem : Finished corrections.
	* GlRenderSystem : Beginning to implement FBOs.

2012-07-14  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* GlRenderSystem : Corrected lights rendering, not tested with shaders yet.
	* General : Removed CASTOR_TRACK calls. Still debugging shaders support.

2012-07-13  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* CMake : Modified CMakeLists (put project creation function in 
	*   Project.cmake).
	* Dx9RenderSystem : Created class DirectX that calls D3D functions and
	*   performs checks, so no more dirty "CheckDxError" in the renderer code.
	* Castor3D : Still need to know why lights don't seem to be applied.

2012-07-12  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* Castor3D : Corrected a buffer's bug => it rerenders !!

2012-07-11  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* GlRenderSystem : Modified a bit GlContext (MSW and X11) to initialise it
	*   using 2.1 In debug mode
	* Castor3D : Started to update documentation

2012-07-10  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* CastorUtils : Ended documentation
	* CastorUtils : Modified a bit Point, relocated functions that shouldn't be
	*   in that class in a small helper class : point. It holds : normalise,
	*   get_normalised, dot, all distance functions, cos_theta, negate.

2012-07-09  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* General : Compiled on Linux with GCC 4.7.
	* CastorUtils : Removed mostly all Boost dependencies (only left
	*   boost::thread for compilers that do not support std::thread).
	* CastorUtils : Comments ... Comments

2012-07-06  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* CMake : Added MINGW GCC4.7 support in CMakeLists.txt
	* General : Corrected few compile time errors with GCC
	* Castor3D : Removed Engine threaded main loop
	* CastorViewer : Relocated m_pCastor3D destruction and ImageLoader::Cleanup
	*   call in the OnDestroy event handler
	* CastorUtils : Continued documentation
	* CMake : Finished modifications

2012-06-29  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* CastorUtils : Removed String, created StrUtils
	* CastorUtils : Still documenting

2012-05-13  Sylvain Doremus  <dragonjoker59@hotmail.com>
	* General : Completed NEW, README, ChangeLog and AUTHORS.
	* Removed std::move (it was a great mistake)
